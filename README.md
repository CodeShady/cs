# `cs` - CodeShady's 42 Tool
42 Helper Script!

## Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **First, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:**
```
$ pip3 install c_formatter_42
```

To start using this tool, grab the main `csverify.py` file and run the program to automatically create your `config.json` file. By default, a `csdata` folder will be created and placed in your `~/Documents/csdata/` folder. These generated files are used by the program later.

Find the `config.json` file generated by the program and edit the variables to your preferences.
```
{
    "USER":  "myusername",
    "EMAIL":  "user@student.42.fr",
}
```

**(Optional ü§∑)**
For quick and easy usage, create an alias in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file depending on which shell you're using. Point the alias to the location of the `csverifiy.py` file you downloaded from this GitHub repository.

**(~/.zshrc)**
```
alias cs="python3 ~/path/to/csverify.py"
```
Open a new shell or run `source ~/.zshrc` to update the changes to your shell session.

```
#### C File Template (with 42 Header)
Create a new C program with the required 42 header.
```
$ cs c --new my_new_program.c
```
#### Compile & Run your code
Compile and run your C code with the recommended compiler flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`

Check your code with the `norminette`

üòé Don't worry, the flag `-R CheckForbiddenSourceHeader` is used by default!
```

```
#### Norminette Auto Formatter
Format your C code automatically for the `norminette`
```
$ cs c --format my_code.c
```
#### Simulate Moulinette Code Grading 
If you have C code that prints the correct **output** that has successfully passed the Moulinette, use the `grade` mode to check whether the output of your code matches the correct output.

Use `--answer` followed by a C program to specify the code previously graded by the Moulinette.
```
$ cs grade my_own_code.c --answer test.c
```

### üëâ Git
#### Add, commit, push (all-in-one)
The tool below adds all changed files, commits them, and then pushes them to your git repository.
```
$ cs git --push
```
#### Just Commit
To add all changed files and commit them automatically **without pushing to your repository**, use the following:
```
$ cs git --commit
```
#### Log
Log your git history
```
$ cs git --log
```
